ðŸŽ‰ Excited to Share: My New 'Guess the Number' Game! ðŸŽ®

Iâ€™ve developed a fun browser-based game where players guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10.
The game gives instant feedback on whether the guess is correct or not, and the score decreases with each wrong guess.
A great way to brush up on JavaScript and interactive UI features like color feedback and dynamic score tracking.
Give it a try!

ðŸ’» Built using:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Itâ€™s a small project, but itâ€™s all about continuous learning and improving my frontend development skills. ðŸŽ¯
